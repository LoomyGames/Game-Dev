INSTRUCTIONS


The playable built game is located in the "Game Build" folder.

The project files are located in the "Project Files" folder.

The game has all of the controls in the main menu, under controls; The goal of the game is explained, also there is no laoding screen so if after pressing a button or
going through a gate the game freezes it's most likely just loading, not crashing, please do not tap anything.

CONTROLS - just in case:

W,A,S,D - move the player and the plane
Left click: Shoot with the plane
E - interact, as prompted
Space: Jump
Space and ctrl in the plane: ascend or descend
Mouse movement controls both the player camera and the plane direction

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

The project might be lacking lighting due to storage optimizations, so when the project is open, go to the lighting settings and click generate (if auto-generate is not 
already enabled). 

Afterwards go to File -> Build Settings; Add all of the scenes from the "Scenes" folder in the build section (the order does not matter), select the target platform and
press build.
